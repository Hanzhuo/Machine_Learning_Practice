# Machine_Learning_Practice

Practice code for machine learning algorithm

These algorithms are written by Python


My current machine learning pratice code include:

### Binary classifiers:

I used UCI Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set which can be found [here] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes)

* Maximum likelyhood estimation classifier 
* Naive Bayes classifier
* KNN (This one uses KDtree instead of bruteforce from sklearn so that the time complexity is O(nlogn))
* parzen_windows_likelyhood (also use KDtree from sklearn)
* ...
